SMS Tetris 
Fourth release (second release with source code) 04/20/2000


About the Source Code:

Comments in the source code should explain most of what's going on.
If you have any more questions, feel free ta ask.

About the Game:

It's tetris. You know what you must do. Now, go!

Why Tetris?

Because we were talking about tetris in SMS dev, and so I thought I'd give it a shot.
Because it's probably the simplest real game to write, and I wanted to keep it simple so I 
might actually finished it.
Because the SMS was one of the few systems that didn't have tetris for it already.
(or so I thought, I've seema  'super tetris' on the list of sms games dumped, 
but I've never seem it. or was it a game gear release?)
Because it was there.
Certainly NOT for love of the game. Bleah. Tetris. Didn't much like it to begin with,
and I'm right sick of it by now.

About what's wrong with it:

-No sound
-No title screen or dancing russians
-Would like to add more flourish
-More modes of play needed.



Compatiblity:
Runs on Meka .40, .51, and the latest BRSMS.
Doesn't run on NeoSMS, because it doesn't correctly emulate port 2. Heh-heh.
Or more likely, it's either a bug in my port queue (don't seem to be) or in Neo
SMS's Z80 emulator.
Untested on any other emulators, though it probably runs just fine.
Might even run on a real SMS, if you can figure out how to get it there.
(if you have some idea how, note that the game only addresses the first bank of memory (16k)).



Bug reports:

Sure, send 'em over.

Acknowledgments (thanks to..):
-Ricardo Bittencourt, for writing the only SMS emulator with a good built in debugger.
 I'd never have gotten this far without it.
-Richard Talbot-Watkins, for writing the SMS documentation that I primary used to develop 
 this rom.
-Charles Mac Donald, for writing the supplementary VDP documentation, that cleared up a lot
 of things for me.
-'Neon Spiral Injector', for the original SMS documentation I used to get a fundamental
 idea of it all, and for shooting the shit with me way back when I was all talk and no game.
-Zoop, for all the knowledge shared, and hosting s8-Dev.
 Also for writing the emulator that I used to relieve those glorious 8-bit days of my youth,
 and relentlessly  persuing cartridges to the ends of the eart.
-Nyef, for his sarcastic counsel
-Chris Francis, (consuleemu), for giving me 'Mad Kudos'. 
 That's the pie in the sky we're all  reaching for, after all.
