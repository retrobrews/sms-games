Introduction:
=============

  Your server full with all those 15 years old Sega Master System software,
of which nobody cares anymore since ages, unfortunately is being   attacked
by some ISDA agents and they want to format your only hard disk   you  ever
owned (40MB).

  They are attacking from various ports,  so you have  to  aim  your   ping
bombs more precisely with the joypad keys or the joystick. Press (A) or (B)
to shoot.

Good Luck.
