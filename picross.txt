How to play
===========

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picross

Picross puzzles are pictures described by "hints". Each row and column has a
collection of numbers; for example, if it says

2 2

that tells you that there's 2 black pixels, then a gap, then 2 more black
pixels. There might be some white pixels on the left or right, or there might
not. So if the board width is 5 pixels, this tells you that it looks like:

[XX XX]

How about this:

1 2

This could fit in three ways:

[X XX ]
[X  XX]
[ X XX]

...but in all cases, the fourth pixel is black. So you can fill that in.

What about this: the board already looks like this:

[  X  ]

and the clue is just

2

We can tell for sure that the first and fifth pixels will not be black, so we
mark them with dots:

[. X .]

In all the above cases, the pixels that were filled in (either black, or dots)
will become clues for the columns, and so on - until you can solve the whole
board and see what the picture is!



Controls
========

Title screen:
L/R     Select a level
1       Start the game
2       Increase the level number until it gets to a puzzle you didn't complete
        yet

In-game:
D-pad   Move the cursor
1       Set a blank pixel to black
        Set a black pixel to blank
        Set a dotted pixel to blank
2       Set a blank pixel to dotted
        Set a dotted pixel to blank
        Set a black pixel to blank
Pause   Show the pause menu

You can hold a button down while you are moving to "draw" the current action
over multiple pixels.

Pause menu:
U       Select a new background music
D       Give up the current level



More levels
===========

It's hard to make new levels that have a 100% definite solution. However, the
same tools that are useful for entering known-good levels are useable for
making new levels and testing if they're playable. Look for the source package
on my website for those tools.
