On-line documentation
=====================

There will, at some point, be a nice web-based version of this document - 
complete with images. It won't be up by the time of the competition, but it
should exist within a week of its deadline. The online document supercedes
this one.

http://www.aypok.co.uk/digger_ball/



What is it?
===========

"Digger Ball" is a game for the Sega Master System, based on the code for
"Digger Chan" - a game I made for last year's coding competition. Despite this,
most of the code in this game is new - most of the code remaining from "Digger
Chan" is just the structure of the the game and stuff that draws the graphics.
Both games are open source, so check for yourselves. :)

It is basically a "Breakout" clone - but with a "Digger Chan" theme. :)

This game was created by Aypok and PlayGeneration for "SMS Power!"'s 2007
coding competition. As well as the game binaries and this documentation, you
will find the full source code and data-files for assembling this game. The
code is released under the GNU/GPL v2 (see the file titled "licence.txt").

I originally started work on this year's entry last September, but didn't get
much further than a basic engine. I should point out that that was a completely
different game to this. :) With the deadline for the competition getting closer
and closer, I decided to make an entry - but with a different game.

I had an idea for a 'mini-game' to place within "Digger Chan", between certain
levels - and since it used a lot of "Digger Chan"'s code (or so I thought),
it'd be nice and quick to write.

Over a few evenings I hacked together a very rough version of the game and sent
a copy to PlayGeneration. It was crappy, but PlayGeneration saw promise in it
and started coming up with cool ideas for the game. Over the following weeks
we worked together to create what you have before you.

This game has been tested on Meka 0.72 and the latest SVN build, Osmose and
real SMS consoles! It works on them all - with one exception: see 'Why two
ROMs?' for details.

Enjoy - and don't forget to vote!


Aypok...



Why two ROMs?
=============

Because I suck at coding? There's a bug in the code that only appears on real
hardware - emulators don't have a problem with it.

The only difference between them is that 'digger_ball.sms' has explosions when
blocks get destroyed and 'digger_ball-no_explosions.sms' doesn't.

If you want to play the game on real hardware, try the 'no_explosions' version.

To be clear: 'digger_ball.sms' is the entry for the competition - the other ROM
is soley for those who wish to run it on a real SMS.



Story
=====

Digger chan, having made it down to the milk pipes that traverse the globe,
often finds caverns with loose rocks hanging from the ceiling. They are way
too unsafe for "M.O.O. Milk Co."'s other pipe engineers to work in, so you have
to clear them.

The only problem is that there are no ladders long enough. All you have
available to remove these dangers is your trusty spade and a purpose-built
rock-busting ball. Therefore, you have to destroy the precariously dangling
rocks by using your spade to propel the ball into them!

Remember that the engineers are very busy people, so if you fail three time you
will be fired!



Basic info
==========

The object of this game is to destroy all the coloured blocks that appear on
screen by 'batting' your ball into them. It's very simple. :) Just don't let
your ball it the floor!

To bat the ball with your spade, all you need to do is let the ball hit you.
If you connect with the ball dead-on, the ball will be deflected - that is; it
will be bounced back up, but its horizontal direction will remain unchanged. If
you want the horizontal direction to be reversed, you must let the ball hit you
further down. But not too far down, or you'll miss it!

There are three terrains in which you must work; Arctic, City and Desert. They
each have their own distinctive colour-scheme: Arctic has lots of 'cold'
colours - blues, purples, etc. The City terrain has 'bold' colours - red, blue,
green and yellow. The Desert has 'hot' colours - red, orange and yellow.

Each block you destroy will give you one point. Each block of TNT you detonate
will give you ten points, plus the points for all the blocks it destroys in the
explosions. TNT will not detonate any surrounding TNT - there are no chain
reactions.

There are twenty levels in the game.

You get an extra try for every two levels you complete.



Difficulty settings
===================

When you press Start on the title screen, you will be given an options menu.
From here, you can select the difficulty of the game - or view the credits
page.

Easy:
    You move fast and the ball moves at a medium pace.

Medium:
    You move at the same pace as the ball - medium speed.

Hard:
    You travel slowly and the ball moves fast.



Power-ups
=========

There are eight power-ups in the game:

Deadly Ball: (Icon: Asterisk)
    This is both a blessing and a curse. The Deadly Ball is just that -
    deadly! Do not try to bat it with your spade, just keep away from it. The
    ball becomes twice as big and much faster than normal - and it catches
    fire!
    
    Because of its power, it will not bounce off of destroyable blocks - it
    will plough through them, destroying everything in its path, until it hits
    a solid wall.
    
    This ball will bounce off the floor without losing a try! Do not try to
    stop it from hitting the floor. When it hits to floor, that section of the
    floor will catch fire! Fire is hot! Do not touch! The flames do die down
    after a short while, though.
    
    If you have the Deadly Ball power-up, collecting the Dual Ball power-up
    (see below) will have no effect. The reverse is also true.
    
Spade-Thrower: (Icon: Spade)
    This allows you to throw your spade at blocks. Your spade travels in a 
    straight line up and then back down again - it cannot move horizontally.
    When your spade hits a block, it will destroy it and then return back down
    towards you.
    
    Once thrown, you need to pick up the spade. If you don't pick it up, it
    will lie on the floor until you collect it.
    
    Remember that you need your spade to bat the ball! If you aren't holding
    your spade, you cannot bat the ball! Be careful.
    
    Press button two to throw the spade. Simply walk over the spade to pick it
    back up.
    
TNT: (Icon: Sticks of TNT)
    This power-up is simple: all destroyable blocks are turned into TNT! TNT is
    very useful because it destroys all the blocks directly connected to it.
    
Dual Ball: (Icon: Two balls)
    With this, you get given a second ball to bat at the blocks. This is very
    useful, since you can effectively destroy twice as many blocks. Are you
    quick enough to juggle two of these balls at once?
    
    Don't worry if not - you can lose one of them, yet not lose a try. As long
    as you keep one ball going, you'll be fine.
    
    You cannot have the Dual Ball power-up if you have the Deadly Ball;
    collecting it will be ignored. The same goes for collecting the Deadly Ball
    power-up when you have Dual Ball.
    
Mini Chan: (Icon: Stick man)
    Oh no! This isn't very good! You shrink to half the size when you collect
    this power-up. You'll have to a lot more accurate when batting the ball,
    since it'll be much harder to hit when you're this small.
    
Ball Speed-Up: (Icon: Big arrow down)
    This makes the ball travel very fast! Too fast? that's for you to decide.
    It allows you to destroy blocks more quickly, but makes it much more tricky
    to hit!
    
Ball Slow-Down: (Icon: Down arrow with dotted lines)
    This makes the ball much slower than normal. Whilst it may make it much
    easier to bat around, it also means it'll take you longer to destroy all
    the blocks.



How to play
===========

Left:
    Move Digger Chan left.

Right:
    Move Digger Chan right.

Button 1:
    Launch ball (at the start of the level only)

Button 2:
    Throw spade (only when Spade-Thrower power-up is enabled).



Tools used
==========

Ubuntu Linux:       OS of choice. :)
Vim:                For writing the code.
WLA-DX:             Assembler.
BMP2Tile:           For converting the title screen to SMS data.
Tilemap Editor:     For converting the two intro screens to SMS data.
The GIMP:           Editing images.
KolourPaint:        Editing images and prototyping some tiles.
Mekanix:            Emulator used to test and debug this game.
Osmose:             Emulator used to test the music and the game.
MOD2PSG:            Tracker used for creating the music.



Other boring info
=================

The file called "generic_stuff.inc" is pretty much the one used in Maxim's
tutorials on coding for the SMS - I have used it, with changes, in this game.

Some of the graphics, with the exception of the intro screens, the player,
and the font, were written by hand - not drawn in a paint program and
converted... Several of the tiles were prototyped (designed) in KolourPaint
and were then converted by hand to code. The tiles/tile-map for the intro
screens were created with an application I wrote and creatively dubbed
"TilemapEditor". The title screen was converted using Maxim's "BMP2Tile"
application, as was the player's sprite.

All the power-up images were converted from images by hand... Not fun. :)

The code is released under the GNU/GPL v2, which means you can edit, change,
etc, the code for this game and redistribute it - but you MUST in turn make
your code open and free for everyone to use. For more details on the GPL,
please see the file "licence.txt". If you do use the code in some way, I'd
love to hear about it. :)

The code is, for the most part, heavily commented - so it should be easy to
follow and understand. Having said that, my coding style is sometimes viewed
as "odd" - sometimes it is down-right badly done. I don't claim that this
code is perfect, or even great - but it does work. Usually. :)




Cheats
======

While there are no cheats built into this game, you can still cheat if you have
something to alter the contents of RAM whilst the game is running - Meka allows
you to do this. I will list a few useful RAM locations here with what they do,
so you can cheat your way through the game - or just get to see it all without
having to play through it. :)

A full list of RAM locations and what they do can be found at the top of the
main code file.

    $c004 - Player speed. Sane values are 1 and 2.
    $c00e - Number of lives left. Binary coded decimal.
    $c012 - Ball speed. Sane values are 0, 1 and 2.
    $c026 - The current level. Binary coded decimal
    $c027 - Level complete flag. Set to 1 to end the current level.
    $c046 - Set to 255 to make all blocks into TNT.
    $c04b - Set to 1 to become immune to the Deadly Ball.



Known bugs
==========

    - It'll sometimes finish the level even if there is a block or two left.
    - Explosions screw up on real hardware, leaving them on screen.
    - On real hardware (when explosions are enabled), it sometimes doesn't know
      when levels are done.
    - If you have the Dual Balls power-up and then collect Deadly Ball power-up
      it will apparently lock-up the entire system. Probably vice-versa, too.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
                       59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA


Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into

consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
