Waimanu
Game for Master System 

1.0	28 Oct 2015	Disjointed Studio (The Dig, sverx, Genecyst, Mu Ho)


Our planet is threatened by Wekas, red and evil alien jellies who invade Earth with the intention of colonizing it and subduing all forms of life. 
Despite being only a little blue penguin, our hero the daring Waimanu will face the invader to defend the freedom of our planet.

Here's the official announcement post on our blog (includes video footage)

How to play [short explanation]
Waimanu should squash the Wekas pushing blocks against them.
Walls will vibrate if hit and will stun leaning Wekas making them vulnerable.
Lots of points are awarded for lining up the three special blocks in every level.

- Direction pad to move our hero around
- 1/START to push/break blocks and to hit walls
- 2 to use a special feature (available if you picked up a bonus... read the full "How to play" for more details)
- PAUSE to pause/unpause the game. Let your fingers rest when needed :)

Complete how to play instructions.

4 different areas with their own tune and effects and 8 different levels per area are provided for your enjoyment.

The game has been tested mainly on Emulicious and MEKA emulators and on my PAL SMS II (at both 50/60Hz) using a Master EverDrive. 
Should run correctly also on an original SMS and on a Genesis/MegaDrive.

We hope that you enjoy the game. If you spot bugs or hardware glitches, please let us know. Thank you! :)
