Ȼi̅x̅ (CIX)
Game for Master System 
1.00	27 Mar 2016	PkK

Ȼi̅x̅ is an action/puzzle game inspired by Qix. 
It has a simultaneous two-player mode.

I originally wrote the game for the ColecoVision. 
This is a port to the Sega consoles. 
It should work on SG-1000, SC-3000, Mark III 
and Master System, but so far has only been tested 
in the emulator Meka, not yet on real hardware.

I consider this version a demo, since it has only 
one level. I intend to make an improved version later. 
The current demo version should already help in 
finding bugs or violations of UI expectations.

Manual:
Once Qix tried to invade our universe,
entering at the arcade halls, and was fought
back by restless arcade players.
Now Ȼi ̅x̅ has followed. Careful not to repeat
the mistakes of its predecessor, it tries a
different route - through the ColecoVisions!
Will the ColecoVision players be up to the
challenge?
The goal of the game is to claim a
supermajority of the playing field by fencing
off parts of the central black area, filling them
with blue.
The player controls a diamond-shaped marker
(red for the first, blue for the second player) .
The direction of the marker can be changed
using the joystick. When the direction
indicated by the joystick is toward the blue
outside, the marker stops. When i t is directed
towards the black inside, a Stix is started. The
Stix is completed when the marker reaches
the border again. At that moment, the part of
the black area that does not contain Ȼi ̅x̅ is
filled.
When the player touches a Stix (e. g. by
moving in a spiral pattern) a l i fe is lost. When
A marker is touched by Ȼi ̅x̅ whi le drawing a
Stix, alifeis lost. When a merker is touched
by Sparx, a life is lost.
Sparx are spawned by Ȼi ̅x̅. When they reach
the border of the black area, they keep
moving along i t. Depending on the current
level , Ȼi ̅x̅ can spawn up to four Sparx.
Another aspect of the game depending on the
current level is the aggressiveness and speed
at which Ȼi ̅x̅ moves.
Sometimes a yel low bonus symbol appears
on the field. Capturing i t by drawing a Stix
through i ts middle or fi l l ing the area i t is in
resul ts in extra points for the score. Ki l l ing
Sparx or markers by fi l l ing the area they are
in also resul ts in extra points.
A level is won once a large enough part of the
black area has been fi l led in blue. At easy
di fficul ty 50% need to be fi l led, at medium
di fficul ty 75% need to be fi l led, and at hard
di fficul ty 90% need to be fi l led.
The current score of the first player is
displayed in the upper right corner. Next to it
is the numbers of l i fes remaining for the first
player. In two player mode, the corresponding
numbers for the second player are displayed
in the upper left corner. The current level is
always displayed in the middle.
The game version number can be found in
the difficul ty selection screen.
