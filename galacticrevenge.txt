It's the year 33XXX. Dirty aliens from a faraway galaxy emptied your refrigerator and killed your boyfriend. 
Confident in their superiority, they also had the nerve to steal your beloved Master System.

NOW THEY'VE GONE TOO FAR...

Your are Olivia Gun. Get your blastin' shoes on and pick from three killer outfits. Wield fire, spread shots, lasers, and even shurikens.

Wipe the grins off their faces as you jump, shoot, and fight your way through their ship and turn them into scrap as payback for their heinous deeds!

A short game, testing what can be done with 1mb rom. Trying to do my most polished game up to date. It began trying to do a Sunsoft Gremlins 2 engine clone. 
I think has evolved and now has it own indentity.

    20 stages
    4 bosses
    intro & ending
    minigame at stage 13
    All my love for 8 bits video games, z80 hardware, and the sms community. 

I want to give thanks to Ray Commend, which did really good work with the boxes and the video, and Richard Morgan for his awesome game illustration. 
Also to my tester, their opinions have been really valuable.
