Cye
Game for Master System 
1.00	27 Mar 2016	PkK
 
This is a port of the Boulderdash/Sokoban-like game Kye to the Sega consoles. It is based on a port I originally wrote for the ColecoVision, 
but there are a few differences, in particular in the menu interface and the graphics.

It should work on SG-1000, SC-3000, Mark III and Master System, but so far has only been tested in the emulator Meka, not yet on real hardware.

There is code in the game to automatically detect the system it is running on. On the Mark III and Master System the full graphics are used, 
while the SG-1000 and SC-3000 have simplified graphics. Unfortunately I don't know of any emulator that emulates the hardware features for 
the autodetection correctly, and don't have SG-1000 or SC-3000 hardware myself.

I consider this version a demo version, since it does not yet have all the levels I want to put into this game.
