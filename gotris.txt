Gotris is the impossible mix of the ancient game of GO and the mighty Tetris. 
Surround pieces from one colour with the ones of the other colour in order to clear them and earn points!

Gotris is based in a prototype game that I made with PyGame back in 2006-2007. 
I never polished it, but I had the concept in the back of my mind. 
As I spent a couple of weeks on medical leave at the beginning of March, I decided to try to port the idea to the SMS. 
It has been programmed on a hurry, recycling some code from other projects, and it can be improved a lot, but it's playable. 
It has used devkitSMS by Sverx.

Graphics have been done by ManuTrigger, and music has to be provided by Davidian. 
First version has placeholder music from another project.

Things to improve:

    Better Playability (not really challenging now)
    Different ingame backgrounds
