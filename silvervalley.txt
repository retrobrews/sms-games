Silver Valley
Game for Master System 

1.00	31 Dec 2017	eruiz00

Well.. i wanted to finish it today (tomorrow i travel for a week) but i had no time (only graphic updates, as i have 
only 200 bytes for code with z88dk with opt-code-size and 1kb free on banks) so, at least, i publish first images of next game: Silver Valley.

This time will have to kill a dragón, but that wont be easy....

64 stages, with an story driving the action, rpg like.

Several gameplay schemes, platforming, flying/shmupping, sailing...

Seven bosses

One minigame included

All my hard work and love for gaming put here.

Next week i will return.

Regards.
