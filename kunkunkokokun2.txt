 This game is a tribute to old school arcade games.
 It is cute, short, yet difficult and unforgiving.

  - A PRINCESS TO SAVE

 Story
-------------------------------------------
 
  1. KunKun is a happy orange blob.
  2. KokoKun is a happy pink princess blob.
  3. KokoKun was taken hostage by some evil black blob.
     (who hides in the SMS video memory but doesn't show up on screen
      because I did not have time to implement it yet)
  4. KunKun has to go and save KokoKun.
  5. The world is saved, everyone can live in peace.
  6. Repeat 5 times until insanity.

 Made using
-------------------------------------------
 
  - WLA-DX for assembling Z80 code.
  - Paint Shop Pro 7 for drawing graphic and level mockups.
  - Maxim's Bmp2Tile for generating tileset and tilemap.
  - Visual Studio 7 for editing.
  - MEKA for emulating and debugging.

-------------------------------------------
 TODO
-------------------------------------------

Things I would like to implement: 
 
  - Sound FX.
  - Life and bonus system not enabled. Infinite lives.
  - Game Over and Continue screen.
  - Title screen / password system missing. Don't try to reach the sun! :)
  - Better ending sequence.
  - Plenty of game features I thought about that were not implemented.
  - Fix sprite flickering on Level 4 on real hardware by using tilemap for doors.
  - More cute animations.
  - More levels.
  - More fun.
  
 Otherwise the game is playable and complete.
