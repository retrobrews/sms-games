Game for Master System

Music is well known tunes except for "ditty" which was originally composed by Sherpa. 
This is my first ever Z80 project and SMS game so go easy ;) Tested on MEKA, Kega Fusion and Emulicious. 
Some of the initial bugs fixed and you now get awarded 1 point for each piece dropped in addition to the regular scoring.

The graphics and palette are not as polished as I would like, I will improve it over time.

I've included appalling box art that is meant to be a shoddy rip off of a SEGA game for a non existent clone called the K9918. 
Hopefully this is not considered too offensive, its only in jest!

I haven't tested this on a real SMS and would appreciate if anyone could try running it on the SMS? 
I've had one report of glitching on Retroarch emulator.
