From the creator of Fix-It Felix Jr for the Sega Mega Drive and the bizarre adaptation of Pringles in video game 
form comes an all new homebrew hit for the Sega Master System. 
This frantic arcade style platformer known as Geki Oko PunPun Maru is based upon the imaginary NES game of 
the same named meme, offering a vibrant visual style and addictive gameplay to boot.

If anything, Geki Oko PunPun Maru features very similar action to that of the original arcade title Mario Bros. 
Instead of spiny shells spawning and heading down to attack, ninjas come flying from above and it's up to you 
to tackle them with your vertical shooting huffs and puffs over 12 stages. This strange projectile is a play 
on the game's title which according to the origin of the meme roughly translates to 'being angry, in a cute way'.

Internet and Japanese culture aside, Mega Drive and Master System developer Future Driver has released this 
unique ROM for free online which can be downloaded below - just don't lose your cool playing it!
