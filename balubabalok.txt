LAst weeks I have been working on a little game for the LD retro compo.
I had to choose between all retro systems and this page, the forums and related links got me caught on SMS and SDCC.

So this is my little contribution to the scene . Hope you enjoy! 

Baluba Balok is a cool platform Pac-Man style game for Master System.
