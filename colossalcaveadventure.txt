Description

This is my entry for the context: it's called Colossal Cave Adventure SAM Edition. 
As the name says, it's basically an adaptation of the classic Colossal Cave Adventure for Twee2SAM. 
So far, the base layout of the cave is already there; it was semi-automatically converted from the 
source code of the Inform version (http://ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXgamesXsourceXinform.html) 
and then manually cleaned up. Currently, almost all of the obstacles and puzzles are missing; 
I intend to add them later. 
Just for kicks, I have also added a few images, hand sketched by someone with zero artistic talent (me) :P
