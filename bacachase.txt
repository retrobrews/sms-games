This time the originality is zero, though, as this is a somewhat well crafted version 
of the old game “Robot Chase” in which a bunch of evil guys (or robots) chase after you relentlestly albeit in turns – 
You move, they move. If two baddies collide with each other, they die (become Zombies) and you score 
(you score points, don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing to do with necrophilia in this game).
