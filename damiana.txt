Damiana.

This is my submission for the Y2Kode contest held by Lik-Sang.
It's a small game for the Sega Master System.

Well, the game itself is not fully developed (not by a long shot) so it might better be
described as a demos of a side scrolling game engine. When the deadline was extended I 
had delusions of grandeur and abandoned my original entry for a more complicated format
(side scrolling is a pain to pull of on an SMS, with sprite clipping, etc). 

I didn't even get a full level finished because I started nit-picking on the game engine,
but it's still the most complicated homebrew rom for the SMS yet. Hopefully there will be
a similar contest next year, I will -own- this category.

Featuring:

-All original graphics (what little there is)
-Side scrolling shooting mayhem
-Lik Sang's URL in flashy shiny text!
-A music-free environment for better concentration.
-Sound effects reminiscent of your atari 2600.
-Collision detection between sprites as well as with the background.
-Hand taylored z80 assembly craftmanship


The sample level has one variety of enemy, and two items: 'S' for speedup, 'V' for inVincibility.
The enemies are mean, but it's beatable. And there's no real reward for winning it! How about that!

Anyhow, win (heh) or lose I've represented the 'team', Sega 8-bit coders. I hope to flesh out this game
engine into a full-fledged game in time, with the help of others. More progress on my SMS development page:
