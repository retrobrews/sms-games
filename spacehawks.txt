Space Hawks is a galactic shoot'em up in the style of Galaxian. 
As in Galaxian, the player's space ship can only move along the horizontal axis. 
When an alien is killed, the player must avoid the debris of the alien. 
At advanced levels the player must also be careful with space mines that move around the game screen.

This game is the unofficial port of the Amstrad game to the Sega Master System. 
I built it for the SMS Power! devkitSMS Coding Competition 2016. Final ROM is 32kb, with 14kb from the assets.

It's my first try on SMS, while I develop for 15years on Genesis. 
I learnt a lot on this one and fixed my bad knowledge on the VDP, thank to sverx and SMSPower members.

Please note that I was unable to fix, for now, the glitch which occurs on some sprites while playing. 
Competition deadline is coming, so I'll fix it later, I hope.

Source code is available on https://bitbucket.org/SpritesMind/spacehawks_sms (dev branch until I fix the bug)

Special thanks to sverx, ichigo and Maxim
