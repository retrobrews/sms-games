ASTROSWAB
Description:
One day it just happened: Giant, flaming rocks swirling through the atmosphere and crushing everything in their path! 
There is talk of an alien invasion - people claim to have seen flying saucers and hi-tech guided missiles. 
Who can we depend on to swab the sky clean of danger? You guessed it... Swabby is back!

The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible. You guide Swabby the snail through different 
areas of increasing difficulty, while shooting down asteroids, missiles and even the occasional UFO. 
Be sure to grab the juice, cakes and other bakery goodies – they will boost your score and make Swabby shoot even faster. 
Don’t let the flaming asteroids (the so-called spinners) reach the ground!

Please refer to the included instructions sheet for full details on scoring, controls and helpful hints.

Controls:
Move Swabby left or right with the d-pad. Press button 1 to fire. Pause and reset the game with the corresponding buttons on the console.

On the high score list, browse through the letters with the d-pad, type a letter with button 1 and backspace with button 2.

Highlights:
*) Random scene selection creating up to 54 unique playthrough experiences.
*) 100% homebrewn assembler code, graphics and sound.
*) Battery-backed, 10 position high score table with initials input.
*) Swabby is back - this time with quick, upgradeable shooting abilities.

ASTROSWAB
Blast Asteroids, Eat Cakes – and Save the Day!
The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible.
You guide Swabby the snail through different areas of increasing
difficulty, while shooting down asteroids, missiles and even the
occasional UFO. Be sure to grab the juice, cakes and other bakery
goodies – they will boost your score and make Swabby shoot even
faster. Don’t let the flaming asteroids (the so-called
spinners) reach the ground!
Scoring overview:
You have got two different score meters: 1) Your score can
go up or down during the game, depending on the events
described in the table below; 2) your peak score can only go
up, and it is the basis for your progression and possible position
on the high score table.
Object Destroyed Hits ground Hits Swabby
Asteroid 100 - 50 - 100
Shard 200 - 100 - 100
Spinner 400 - 100* - 200
Booster - 500 0 1.000**
Missile 800 0 - 200
UFO 1.000 - -
* You lose one life.
** Swabby’s firing rate improves.
Progression overview:
As your peak score increases, the difficulty ramps up and you
travel through different scenes. The scenes are selected randomly
within each difficulty, creating 54 unique playthrough
experiences. The game ends at 90.000 points.
Difficulty Peak Score Range Scenes
1 0 – 4.999 - Mushroom Valley
- Beach
- Countryside
2 5.000- 14.999 - Desert
- Mountains
- Cloudy day
3 15.000- 34.999 - Night
- Old tree
- Field
4 35.000 – 59.999 - Graveyard 1
- Graveyard 2
5 60.000 – 90.000 - The Moon
High score system:
The high score table has 10 positions. When you run out of lives,
your peak score is compared to the entries in the high score
table. Enter characters with Button 1 and backspace with Button 2.


Battery-backed RAM saves the scores between gaming sessions. If
you ever want to wipe the high score table and start over, do the
following: At the title screen, press UP + Button 1 + Button 2.
You will be taken to a confirmation screen where you can press
DOWN + Button 1 + Button 2 to clear the high score table and reset
Astroswab to the default settings.
HELPFUL HINTS:
Most asteroids explode into two shards. Time your shot carefully
so that you can mop up at least one of the shards before it hits
the ground.
Don’t just shoot wildly up in the sky. You risk accidentally
hitting one of the bakery goods, which will cost you 500 points
and a missed chance for powering up Swabby’s gun.
The homing missile is fast. While it is possible to shoot it, it
is often better to outrun it.
You can’t possibly blast all the incoming asteroids and shards.
When you are out of position, it is better to stay safe at the
cost of a few points.
Destroy the UFO and the spinner as soon as they appear on the
screen. The UFO will quickly fill the screen with bullets that
Swabby cannot destroy, and the spinner will eventually touch the
ground causing you to lose a life.
