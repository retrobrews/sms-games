Acid Reflux V1.1
Game for Master System 

Here's our late entry for the coding compo: Acid Reflux

Robotwo made almost all the graphics, furrtek added the bugs.

Still buggy at high speed, lacks a decent player sprite and falling objects. There will probably be one or two more updates to get things right. As usual, I thought I had enough time :)

Contains procedural music, varying from very annoying to surprisingly melodic.
