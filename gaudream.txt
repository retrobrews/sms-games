Description

Here there's a very preliminar version of a Flappy Bird Clone, called Gaudream.

Press button 1 to "Jump", button 2 to "charge", and down to dive!

Gaudream has been developed by DanySnowyman (Graphics), Davidian (Sound) and me, Kusfo (Code), using the wonderful devkitSMS by sverx.

After some cleaning, I also plan to release the source code.

Enjoy!
