1. Story

You are a knight and your lord has sent you on a daring midnight
raid. A passage has been found into the enemy's castle. Now you
must prepare for close quarters combat! Draw your sword. Defeat 
all the enemy knights and soldiers and you watch their castle 
burn at night. Fail, and your corpse will be left where it fell.
It only takes one blow to win or die, so be careful!  


----------------------------
2. Controls

Starting the game:
Select one of three options -
1) one sword, XX fights to win.
2) one sword, C fights to win.
3) two swords, C fights to win.

To block:
Move the D-pad right or left.
When all the way left, the sword is blocking all blows from the left.
When all the way right, the sword is blocking all blows from the right.
Keep the sword in that position to block.

To strike.
Press 1 to strike from right to left.
Press 2 to strike from left to right.

If you selected two swords, controller 1 controls sword 1,
and controller 2 controls sword 2.

Striking:
If you swing and only hear the sound of metal against metal, the enemy
blocked your strike. Wait for the enemy to let his guard down.
This is usually after a strike. But some enemies never have their 
guard up. The window of attack may be small, so act quickly!

The only foe who can not be defeated in one hit is the gold knight.
If it makes it to one side, it can strike a blow that can not be blocked.
But your strikes can make it change direction. Keep it in the middle,
and keep striking until it falls over!

Blocking:
The enemy will move to the side he intends to strike from.
The background will flash red a half-second before the enemy is about to strike.
Block on the correct side before then.
Stay in the block position and do not swing until the enemy sword leaves the screen.
To not block a blow means instant death!
