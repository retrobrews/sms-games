Minesweeper v1.1
----------------

My entry into the sms power 2014 coding competition.

This is my take on the classic computer game Minesweeper for the sega master
system.


Controls:
---------

Button 1 - uncover a tile
Button 2 - mark a tile with either a flag or a question mark
Pause    - toggle music

The aim of the game is to find all the bomb tiles by uncovering non-bomb
tiles on the board. If you accidentally uncover a bomb then you lose.
The number on the uncovered tiles tell you how many bombs surround the
tile.
You can select from three different boardsizes.

Music:      Niloct

Software used:
--------------
Grafx2
Gimp
Bmp2tile
Mod2PSG
WLA-DX
Vim

Tools:
------
Master everdrive USB (for testing on my master system 2)

Utils:
------

I've included my unix usb-loader code for the master everdrive. I needed this
as I develop on Mac OS X and the everdrive only comes with windows drivers. :(

I've also included my vim syntax highligting file. It's based on Maxim's 
ConTEXT highlighter.

Todo:
-----

Win / Lose animations + bomb sfx.
Key repeat.



Thanks to www.smspower.org for providing a great resource to the sega 8bit
community. I may release the source at some point.
