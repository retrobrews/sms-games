Description

Hi ! This is our entry for the 2012 SMS Power Coding Competition, it's called "Lost Raider" and because of the lack of time it's unfinished (of course !). 
There is no music nor any sound effect which is nice : you'll be able to play it and to listen to the music competition entries at the same time^^

ichigobankai made the level design and the graphisms/animation, I (vingazole) wrote the code. The game being unfinished, your only goal is to survive 
and to make a big score ;)
I think the controls are obvious : press button 1 to punch/kick, button 2 to jump.
