Astro Force
Game for Master System 

Here are the promised shmup. I wanted to do a classical shooter like those I played 30 years ago.

RSG - Thunder force - Gaiares - Aleste - R-type - MSX nemesis games are my inspiration here. 
Remember the day I bought japanese import gaiares at a little shop here in Malaga. 
The feelings the first time I played. Never will forget that day. That's the spirit.

At title screen, one button enter the game, other enter the jukebox and options page. 
Do yourself a favor and put 6 lifes.

Playability is finely tuned (I think) some memorization and things will be easier. 
There are continues. Ctrl+F1 in emulicious helps a lot! Actually I finish the game with two continues :)
6 stages, each with its own concepts, music, graphics and enemies + final boss stage
11 bosses
30+ enemy types
Intro, ending
What I like the most? the music. Mod2PSG it the perfect tool for a music snob like me.

Source code is included although I not feel him finished (i'm bothering with each time 
less performance issues). Simply, it's my toy. I dont want to stop now. Have to test 
some ideas with retracing and interrupts, test if can update scroll and tiles every 
two frames (instead one as it is now) keeping animation. Optimizing some parts of code.

If someone thinks can help with some custom z80 assembly functions, doing profile at 
emulicious (I cannot... doesn't understand whats really going there), 
I'll send the code. It would be great!

Enjoy!
