   The Game Police are after Bread and Butter! 

   The Game Police are a paramilitary organization that 
enforce draconian standards on modern games. Their code demands that
all modern games released on consoles must have hour long tutorials, 
60 hour story modes, lengthy cut-scenes with no player interaction, 
consist of polygons, and use all 8 buttons on the controller 
among other things. Being in short, easy to pick-up and play games 
with 2-D graphics puts Bread and Butter in violation of multiple 
portions of the code. Men dressed in body armor carrying rifles 
and tazers are now hunting them! Punishment for violating the 
Game Police code includes imprisoment and "re-education" where 
the subject is tortured and broken until they give in to the code.

  Bread is young baking prodigy. Butter is just a fat kid who likes 
to eat the stuff that Bread bakes. Two children don't stand a chance 
against an army of armed grown men! Or do they... 

  Bread has a plan! The highly trained and well equipped officers of 
the game police are expensive,and they're funded by a private investors.
If the private investors were to go broke, they wouldn't be able to pay
their officers, and then would not be able to operate. By sneaking into
the investors' four offices and destroying their computers and 
financial records, the Game Police can be bankrupted. 

   Can these two youths sabotage the Game Police before they are 
captured?

===========

   Each level is broken into four sub-levels.
Sub area 1 - Bread collects eggs.
Sub area 2 - Butter collects milk.
Sub area 3 - Bread collects flour. 
             The Bread of Legend is baked.
Sub area 4 - Butter jumps from platform to platform up a tall building.
             Then he sneaks into the computer room through a window. 
             The Bread of Legend is released and the computer room is 
             destroyed. 

   Once all four computer rooms are destroyed, Bread and Butter run
freely into the sunset.
