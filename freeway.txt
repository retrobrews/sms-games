The game is called Freeway '86 and it's a port/clone/version of Activision's Freeway.
I have put maybe 2 months working on and off into it. Since i had never had programmed anything in C, it took me longer than it should be.
So far, the game is simply a hi-score competition. You are the chicken and you have to cross the street. I want to implement player vs. player, player vs. ai, 
and a mode where you can also move sideways.
It's also mute atm, i want to put sound before the final release (it's my next step, actually).
My idea with this, was keep the scope of the project really simple and doable, i think i've managed that.
I tried to attach the source code, but gmail is nagging me about security. I'll release the source on my github, after the 'official' release.
