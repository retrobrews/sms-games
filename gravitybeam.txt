About
-----

Gravity Beam: Master Gaiden is a new game for the Sega Master System.


Story
-----

It is the 33rd century. Humanity continues its colonisation of the Red
Planet, Mars. Colonists and miners have worked tirelessly for many years,
excavating caverns of unimaginable scope throughout the core of the planet
in search of elusive subterranean minerals.

This devastating work is viewed with contempt by many fringe groups in
colonised space. Private security and intelligence forces are stretched
to breaking point protecting those trying to tame the Red Planet.

One group in particular, claiming to be allies of the 'guardian daimon'
of Mars, have struck many savage blows against the colonisation effort,
attacking mining facilities, dormitories, miners, engineers, scientists
and their families indiscriminately. They claim that the colonisation
efforts are causing irreparable damage to the natural ecosystem of Mars,
and demand that humanity leave at once.

Admist all this madness, a terrorist cell activates after a decade-long
infiltration into the heart of colonial governance. They take a number
of key colonisation personnel hostage. Their demand: the absolute
abandonment of Mars by the human race within twenty-four Earth hours.

The security forces deal with the immediate threat after a bloody and
protracted siege... but, with his final words, the leader of the cell
leaves a chilling warning...

"You may think you have won, but you can -never- win. We have planted a
nuclear device in the heart of Mars. A device capable of annihilating the
entire planet."

"The bomb is armed."

This is where you come in.

You are an ace pilot. The best. Your trusty ship, the Greenwing, is
equipped with a state of the art Gravity BeamTM, capable of hauling any
cargo through the most treacherous terrain.

With only minutes before the bomb detonates, you fly directly into
the caverns of Mars...

You've never had to carry a nuclear bomb before, but how dangerous can
it be?

Your mission:

* Negotiate the caverns of Mars and locate the nuclear device.

* Engage your ship's GRAVITY BEAM to attach the device to your ship.

* Carry it back through the caves and out into space, where it can then
be detonated safely.

GOOD LUCK, pilot. And GODSPEED.

Hints and Tips
--------------

Move slowly: the bomb is fragile!

Allowing the bomb to collide with the cave walls will damage it!
When the box starts blinking, you know you're in trouble. The box
will blink faster the more it is damaged. If the bomb incurs
enough damage, it will explode!

Even getting it caught on something may be enough to destroy it.
If the box gets stuck, detach from it immediately!

Remember your mission: don't place the box on the landing pad! We don't
want it!! You have to drag it out into space. To do this, fly your ship
out of the caves through the opening at the top of the screen near the
starting position while the Gravity Beam is engaged.

The Gravity Beam has a maximum distance before engagement. You can
only engage the beam if you're within about four ships' length of
the box.

The Gravity Beam has a maximum length during engagement. If the box
swings too far away from your ship, the Gravity Beam will be disabled
and the box will go flying across the landscape.

The box is pretty heavy; if you're moving at speed and you make a
sharp turn, the box might drag you into danger!

Your ship is indestructible, as are the cave walls. Colliding with
the walls brings your ship to a dead stop. Use this to your advantage.

The box falls rather slowly through open space.

While you're attached to the box, you will see a dotted line between
the Greenwing and the box.

Fixed a bug with the 'boush' sound effect when trying
to engage the beam outside of the range of the box.

Previously, the percussion of the music would override
the sound effect rather than vice versa.
