WahMunchers R3
By JoppyFurr

You arrive at your red-panda farm, only to find that a pack of snow 
leopards have broken into your paddock and are going after your flock. 

You must build fences to protect your livestock before they get gobbled up: 

-> 10 points for the first wah in a fenced-off area 

-> 20 points for additional wah, as a breeding-bonus 

To build a fence simply press button number one while attempting to move 
into a paddock. 

Once you've separated the species, you'll move on to the next field, 
with even more leopards. You'll need to save at least one red panda per 
round to progress. 


Some technical details: 

-> This game generates a bitmap using a two-bit palette. The tiles are 
repeated for the top and bottom halves of the screen, one half using the 
background palette, and the other half using the sprite palette. This 
allows arbitrary pixels to be drawn to, at the cost of limiting the 
number of on-screen colours. 

-> Three of the possible four colours are selected for the bitmap, which 
leaves seven spaces in the sprite-palette for unique colours in sprites. 

-> The game is developed in C with devkitSMS and sdcc (such a buggy 
compiler!) 


Known bugs and incomplete features: 

-> Animals hitting an incomplete fence should cause some kind of 
penalty, but this is not yet implemented. 

-> Connecting your incomplete fence to itself should cause some kind of 
penalty, but this is not yet implemented. This can currently trigger 
buggy area-filling behaviour. 

-> When shading a solved area, sometimes a line may be missed 

-> As more animals and fences are added to the screen, things can slow 
down quite a bit 

-> When an area is filled, the fill will cover up part of the fence at 
the bottom 

-> No sound yet 


Changes in R2:

  * Dead wah are no-longer counted when deciding to fill-in a paddock or not

  * The text "GAME OVER" will blink above your score when the game ends

  * When filling a paddock, every line is filled rather than only every
second line. (I've improved the line-filling speed, so was able to
remove the every-second-line hack)

Changes in R3:
I've just sent in a new build, R3, which includes the change suggested by sverx to fix drawing over the fences.

I've also turned back on some non-functional code that seems to avoid a compiler bug where the number of animals counted were incorrect (the likely cause of areas not being shaded in when they should be).

Will hopefully be up soon :3
